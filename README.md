## How to Run
1. Copy the project folder into the `htdocs` directory (for XAMPP) or `www` directory (for WAMP).  
2. Open **phpMyAdmin** in your browser.  
3. Create a new database (`game_db`).  
4. Import the SQL file located in the `/database/` folder into this database.  
5. Open your PHP project configuration file (e.g., `config.php`) and update the database connection settings:
   
```php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$dbname = "game_db";
